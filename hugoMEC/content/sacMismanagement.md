# Inadequate accounting safeguards, poor record-keeping practices, and abuse of power led to tens of thousands of dollars of overspending by the Student Activities Commission.

{{< sectionSpacerSC >}}

The Student Activities Commission, a board composed of __ students, overspent its allocated budget by more than $40,000 in the 2019-20 academic year because of insufficient record-keeping and irresponsible accounting practices. Further compounded by abuse of funding authority, SAC spending outstripped its budget with more than three months remaining the in the school year.


SAC, officially a part of the Vice President's Office for Student Affairs, receives most of its annual budget from the Georgetown University Student Associations' Financial Appropriations Committee, which distributes the $84 per semester student activities fee paid by all full-time students. In the 2019-20 academic year, SAC received nearly $400,000 in funding, some 75% of which came from FinApp. SAC receives more funding from FinApp than any other sole group.

Over the past decade, SAC has seen the amount of funding that it receives from FinApp increase dramatically. Though the functions of the various groups that apply for FinApp funding have changed over time, the level of funding that SAC received increased by over 25% in the past five years and has nearly tripled since the 2011-12 academic year. Indeed, in the past academic year, SAC received more funding from FinApp than any other group has for as long as records are available.

This is in large part due to the scale, scope, and number of SAC organizations. With more than 120 clubs eligible for funding and additional groups in "restitution" or "New Club Development," the draw on SAC funds has increased in recent years. As GUSA Senator and SAC Liaison for FinApp Matthew Buckwald (COL '20) wrote in FinApp's 2020 Budget Report, "SAC is growing at a higher rate than any other advisory board. As this concern has been shared in the past I find it necessary to repeat it here."

In addition to funding from FinApp, however, SAC also received funding directly from the Vice President's Office for Student Affairs to the tune of $81,653 and a further $7,447 in a grant award from the Coca Cola Foundation. (The Hoya - need to fact check the Coke number)

Over the course of the academic year, SAC disburses funds to eligible groups in response to requests made at a semesterly Budget Summit, or in response to "ad hoc" requests for funding which can be made on a weekly basis at public SAC meetings. However, ad hoc funding requests are supposedly evaluated in a more rigorous fashion. According SAC's Budget Guide for the Fiscal Year of 2018-19 -- the latest that is publicly available on SAC's website -- "Ad Hoc should be used to support events that we unable to be budgeted for at the time of the Budget Summit, or were unanticipated and unforeseen at the time the budget was developed."

However, the proposals that SAC groups submit during the Budget Summit cannot include funding requests for travel events, certain types of conferences, space costs, security costs, or for equipment costs. As a consequence, groups are forced to turn to the ad hoc process even if they are able to project for these kinds of expenses at the time of the Budget Summit. These rules have been instituted in
