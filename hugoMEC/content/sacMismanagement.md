# Inadequate accounting safeguards, poor record-keeping practices, and abuse of power led to tens of thousands of dollars of overspending by the Student Activities Commission.

{{< sectionSpacerSC >}}

The Student Activities Commission, a board composed of __ students, overspent its allocated budget by more than $40,000 in the 2019-20 academic year because of insufficient record-keeping and irresponsible accounting practices. Further compounded by abuse of funding authority, SAC spending outstripped its budget with more than three months remaining the in the school year.


SAC, officially a part of the Vice President's Office for Student Affairs, receives most of its annual budget from the Georgetown University Student Associations' Financial Appropriations Committee, which distributes the $84 per semester student activities fee paid by all full-time students. In the 2019-20 academic year, SAC received nearly $400,000 in funding, some 75% of which came from FinApp. SAC receives more funding from FinApp than any other sole group.

Over the past decade, SAC has seen the amount of funding that it receives from FinApp increase dramatically. Though the functions of the various groups that apply for FinApp funding have changed over time, the amount of funding that SAC received increased by over 25% in the past five years and has nearly tripled since the 2011-12 academic year. Indeed, in the past academic year, SAC received more funding from FinApp than any other group has for as long as records are available.

In addition to funding from FinApp, however, SAC also received funding directly from the Vice President's Office for Student Affairs to the tune of $84,000 and a further $8,800 in a grant award from the Coca Cola Foundation. (The Hoya - need to fact check the Coke number)
