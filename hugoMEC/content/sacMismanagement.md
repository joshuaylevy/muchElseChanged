# Inadequate accounting safeguards, poor record-keeping practices, and abuse of power led to tens of thousands of dollars of overspending by the Student Activities Commission.

{{< sectionSpacerSC >}}

The Student Activities Commission, a board composed of __ students, overspent its allocated budget by more than $40,000 in the 2019-20 academic year because of insufficient record-keeping and irresponsible accounting practices. Further compounded by abuse of funding authority, SAC spending outstripped its budget with more than three months remaining the in the school year.


SAC, officially a part of the Vice President's Office for Student Affairs, receives most of its annual budget from the Georgetown University Student Associations' Financial Appropriations Committee, which distributes the $84 per semester student activities fee paid by all full-time students. In the 2019-20 academic year, SAC received nearly $400,000 in funding, 75% of which came from FinApp.
