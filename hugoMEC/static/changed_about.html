                    <h2> Much Else Changed is an effort at explaining economic complexity without dumbing it down. Using data visualization, Much Else Changed breaks down important questions about policy and our society.</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p> Economics is an extraordinarily data-rich discipline but too often its public face looks like esoteric mathematics and Greek symbols that hide too much of the "story" from everyday readers. But, economics touches every person and almost every aspect of society so economic literacy in particular is important as literacy in general. Much Else Changed is an effort in advancing and popularizing the discourse of economics and policy.

                    <h3>The Name</h3>
                    <p>In economics the phrase <em>ceteris paribus</em> abounds. It means "all else equal" and is a useful framework for understanding how changing one variable can affect a bigger system. But, in reality, doing analysis in this way is difficult and sometimes conceals important truths.</p> 
                    
                    <p> Policy is inherently interdisciplinary. So, it often makes sense to understand what happens if <em>multiple</em> variables are changing all at the same time. That, additional level of complexity is what Much Else Changed is about. So this project's title is a reference to <em>ceteris paribus'</em> lesser-known brother: <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, which literally translates to "having changed what needs to be changed."</p>

                    <p>Much Else Changed is made entirely with open-source software. As someone without a formal background in web-development, I found the following sources extraordinarily helpful for self-teaching. (Also, never forget that Google is your best friend!) </p>
