      <description>Much Else Changed is an effort at explaining economic complexity without dumbing it down. Using data visualization, Much Else Changed breaks down important questions about policy and our society. Economics is an extraordinarily data-rich discipline but too often its public face looks like esoteric mathematics and Greek symbols that hide too much of the &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; from everyday readers. But, economics touches every person and almost every aspect of society so economic literacy in particular is as important as literacy in general.</description>
