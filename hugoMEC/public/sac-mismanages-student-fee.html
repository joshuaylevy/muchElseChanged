<div class="sectionSpacer"></div>
<p>The Student Activities Commission, a board composed of __ students, overspent its allocated budget by more than $40,000 in the 2019-20 academic year because of insufficient record-keeping and irresponsible accounting practices. Further compounded by abuse of funding authority, SAC spending outstripped its budget with more than three months remaining the in the school year.</p>
<p>SAC, officially a part of the Vice President&rsquo;s Office for Student Affairs, receives most of its annual budget from the Georgetown University Student Associations&rsquo; Financial Appropriations Committee, which distributes the $84 per semester student activities fee paid by all full-time students. In the 2019-20 academic year, SAC received nearly $400,000 in funding, 75% of which came from FinApp.</p>
