Using data visualization, Much Else Changed breaks down important questions about policy and our society.</h2>

But, economics touches every person and almost every aspect of society so economic literacy in particular is as important as literacy in general. Much Else Changed is an effort in advancing and popularizing the discourse of economics and policy.</h3>

<h4 id="the-name">The Name</h4>
<p>In economics, the phrase <em>ceteris paribus</em> abounds. It means &ldquo;all else equal&rdquo; and is a useful framework for understanding how changing one variable can affect a bigger system. But, in reality, doing analysis in this way can conceal important truths. After all, the world doesn&rsquo;t change one variable at at time.</p>
<p>Policy is inherently interdisciplinary. So, it often makes sense to understand what happens if <em>multiple</em> variables are changing all at the same time. That additional level of complexity is what Much Else Changed is all about. This project&rsquo;s title is a reference to <em>ceteris paribus&rsquo;s</em> lesser-known brother: <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, which literally translates to &ldquo;having changed what needs to be changed.&rdquo;</p>

Joshua is a graduate of Georgetown University&rsquo;s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service where he studied International Political Economy, Mathematics, and Japanese. Though he was born in Tokyo, Japan, and grew up around the Asia-Pacific region before moving to the United States for university, Joshua considers Hong Kong home.</p>

<h4 id="how-its-made">How It&rsquo;s Made</h4>
<p>Much Else Changed is made entirely with open-source software. Most things have been created with HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript library called d3.js. Additionally, Hugo is used as a framework with light CMS features. As someone without a formal background in web-development I am always open to tips, feedback, and suggestions. If you find any broken links or things that aren&rsquo;t working properly please let me know!</p>
